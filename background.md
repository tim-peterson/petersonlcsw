I have over 15 years of experience working in the mental health field. I graduated with a BA in Psychology from Washington University in St. Louis and then went on to obtain an MSW from the Brown School at Washington University. I have worked and trained in multiple, diverse settings. I have completed two advanced-training, post-graduate fellowships, one in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) from Harvard Medical School and one in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy from the Massachusetts Institute for Psychoanalysis. I have experience working in research, acute hospital, school, residential, partial-hospital and outpatient settings and have extensive experience and expertise in the treatment of eating disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders and borderline personality disorder. In addition to my private practice, I am also currently on staff as a therapist at McCallum Eating Disorder Center.
